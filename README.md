<strong>Problem Statements</strong><br>
Since Covid-19 has decreased, Indonesia's tourism sector has significantly increased. Based on data from BPS (https://www.bps.go.id/pressrelease/2023/02/01/1974/), the number of tourists has increased by 36.19% in 2022. On the other hand, information technology is also growing rapidly. This can be an initial initiative to attract many tourists, help find suitable destinations, and improve the quality of tourist attractions.

<strong>Background Information</strong><br>
Using machine learning, we will create a tourist destination recommendation system application that matches the input criteria from the user. This feature will make recommendations based on travel categories, budget, location, and the desired rating. Apart from providing tourist recommendations, this application is also supported by features of criticism and input from users for tourist attractions that have been visited so that they can help improve the quality of existing tourist attractions.
